Dynamic Poll
==============

Creating a poll system (similar to Straw Poll) where you create a poll with options to vote on, share the link, and view the results. Most of the functionality is there including; creating the poll, clicking a 'copy link' button, voting and viewing. However, there's a couple things I still have left.

Here's what's left todo:

- **Realtime updates:** Right now a user needs to refresh the 'view' page in order to see any updated results. Need to see changes to a vote without a page refresh
- **Handle Sessions:** Technically a user can just press the 'back' button and vote again. I need to have it so a user can only vote once.
- **CSS Tidy up:** Need to make the page more user friendly and tidy up how it looks.
