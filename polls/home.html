	<h1>Dynamic Poll</h1>
	<p>Another small project I've completed in AngularJS. This polling system allows you to create a poll, share a link, vote on it and see the results.</p>
	<p>Some of the details are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a poll which stores the poll name and options in a mysql databse</li>
		<li>Once the poll is created you can copy your link to share it with others</li>
		<li>Uses php sessions so you may only vote once</li>
		<li>Uses angular's interval to fetch the db results every two seconds so you can see poll results in near real-time</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Future goals:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Implement with firebase for real-time poll tracking, a lot cleaner than querying the databse every two seconds</li>
		<li>Restucture data so I can sort the poll's columns, and put the most voted item on the top of the list</li>
	</ul>
